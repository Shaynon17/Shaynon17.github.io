        <p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2-4
            |<strong> Type:</strong> Memory
            |<strong> Supplies:</strong> 1 Deck |
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of the game is to have the lowest value between your four cards when all players cards are
            flipped up at
            the end.</p>

        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <p>Players are dealt four cards, one card at a time. Players do not look at their cards. Each playerâ€™s cards are
            lined up
            in a row, in front of them, face down. The remaining deck is placed into the middle, and the top card of the
            deck is
            flipped up and placed next to the deck to start the discard pile.</p>

        <!-- <figure>

        <figcaption>Rat A Tat Tat card layout set up picture</figcaption> 
    </figure>  -->



        <h3>Card Value</h3>
        <p>King: 0 points<br>
            Ace: 1 point<br>
            2-10: Face value<br>
            Jack/Queen: 11 points<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>Before play begins, each player is able to look at their two outside cards, and then puts them back facedown. Players
        will want to remember the cards for the game.
        <br><br>
        The player left of the dealer is first to play. Each player has the option to draw the top card of the deck, or the top
        card of the discard pile.
        <br><br>
        If the top card of the discard pile is drawn, the player will swap it with one of their four cards. The card that was
        swapped is placed face up on the discard pile.
        <br><br>
        If the top card of the deck is drawn, the player decides to either swap it with one of their cards or put the drawn card
        in the discard pile. Cards remain face down after a card swap.
        <br><br>
        When a player thinks their cards have a low value, they will knock and announce rat-a-tat-tat after taking a turn. This
        means each other player gets one more turn. Once each player has taken their last turn, all the cards are revealed, and
        the game is over.
</p>



        <h3>Special Cards</h3>
        <p>If a jack is drawn, a player is able to look at one of their cards. The jack is then discarded. <br><br>
        If a queen is drawn, a player is able to switch one of their cards with a card from any player. The cards remain face
        down during the switch. The queen is then discarded.
</p>

        <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
        <p>-A jack or queen can only be used when either is drawn from the deck. If a jack or queen is discarded from a card swap,
        the next player has to draw from the deck. <br>
        -If the middle deck of cards runs out before a player has announced rat-a-tat-tat, the game is over. All players flip up
        their cards and count their value.
</p>

        <h3>Winner</h3>
        <p>Once the cards are revealed, the player with the lowest value of cards wins the game.
