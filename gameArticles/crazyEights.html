        how to play crazy eights with two players or more, here is a simple and fast way to learn.
        <br><br>
        Playing crazy eights with 2-5 players requires one deck. Playing with more than 5 players requires an additional deck.

        <p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2+
            |<strong> Type:</strong> Shedding
            |<strong> Supplies:</strong> 1-2 Decks, Paper/Pen |
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The object of crazy eights is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards each round. Cards with a matching
        suit or a matching number can be played into the discard pile. Players want to have a low score.</p>

        <h3>Deal</h3>
        <p>Deal 5 cards to each player, one at a time. Place the remaining deck in the middle. Flip over the top card from the deck
        and place it next to the deck to start the discard pile.</p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>Do not let other players see your cards. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn. During your turn, you have
        to play a card of the same suit or rank as the top card of the discard pile. If a player is unable to play a card of the
        same suit or rank, they must draw a card until they are able to play a card onto the discard pile. If the player draws
        three cards in one turn and still can not play a card onto the discard pile, they pass their turn. If a player draws a
        card that can be played, the player must then play that card, stop drawing cards, and end their turn.
        <br><br>
        Eights in this game are wild cards, and can be played on any card. Whoever plays an eight will choose a suit. The next
        player must play a card in the suit that was chosen. Each round is played until any player places their last card into
        the discard pile. Scores are then tallied up and a new round is started after the deck is shuffled. Players will play
        rounds until any player's score reaches over 100 points, then the game is over.
        </p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>Players get the points equal to a certain value depending on what cards are left in their hand at the end of the round.
        <br><br>
        The following cards are worth the following points:<br>
        Ace: 1 point<br>
        2-10 (except 8s): Face value<br>
        King/Queen/Jack: 10 points<br>
        8: 50 points
        </p>

        <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
        <p>-An 8 can not be the first card to start the discard pile. If an 8 is the first card, put it on the bottom of the deck,
        and flip over the next card of the deck.<br><br>
        -If the draw deck is gone and a player can not play, that player must pass. If no player can play, the round is over, and
        each player gets points based on their unplayed cards.
        </p>

        <h3>Winner</h3>
        <p>When a player reaches 100 or more points, the game is over. The player who has the least amount of points at the end of
        the game is the winner.</p>
