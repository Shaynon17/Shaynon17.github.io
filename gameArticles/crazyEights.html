        <p class="pseo">Crazy eights is an easy game for kids and families to play. If you want to know what the rules are for crazy eights, and
        how to play crazy eights with two players or more, here is a simple and fast way to learn.
        <br><br>
        Playing crazy eights with 2-5 players requires one deck. Playing with more than 5 players requires an additional deck.
        You will need paper and a pen to keep track of the score.

        <p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2+
            |<strong> Type:</strong> Shedding
            |<strong> Supplies:</strong> 1-2 Decks, Paper/Pen |
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The object of crazy eights is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards each round. Cards with a matching
        suit or a matching number can be played into the discard pile. Players want to have a low score.</p>

        <h3>Deal</h3>
        <p>Deal 5 cards to each player, one at a time. Place the remaining deck in the middle. Flip over the top card from the deck
        and place it next to the deck to start the discard pile.</p>

        <figcaption>Crazy Eights card layout set up picture</figcaption> 
    </figure>  -->


        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>Do not let other players see your cards. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn. During your turn, you have
        to play a card of the same suit or rank as the top card of the discard pile. If a player is unable to play a card of the
        same suit or rank, they must draw a card until they are able to play a card onto the discard pile. If the player draws
        three cards in one turn and still can not play a card onto the discard pile, they pass their turn. If a player draws a
        card that can be played, the player must then play that card, stop drawing cards, and end their turn.
        <br><br>
        Eights in this game are wild cards, and can be played on any card. Whoever plays an eight will choose a suit. The next
        player must play a card in the suit that was chosen. Each round is played until any player places their last card into
        the discard pile. Scores are then tallied up and a new round is started after the deck is shuffled. Players will play
        rounds until any player's score reaches over 100 points, then the game is over.
</p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>Players get the points equal to a certain value depending on what cards are left in their hand at the end of the round.
        <br><br>
        The following cards are worth the following points:<br>
        Ace: 1 point<br>
        2-10 (except 8s): Face value<br>
        King/Queen/Jack: 10 points<br>
        8: 50 points
</p>

        <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
        <p>-An 8 can not be the first card to start the discard pile. If an 8 is the first card, put it on the bottom of the deck,
        and flip over the next card of the deck.<br><br>
        -If the draw deck is gone and a player can not play, that player must pass. If no player can play, the round is over, and
        each player gets points based on their unplayed cards.
</p>

        <h3>Winner</h3>
        <p>When a player reaches 100 or more points, the game is over. The player who has the least amount of points at the end of
        the game is the winner.</p>
