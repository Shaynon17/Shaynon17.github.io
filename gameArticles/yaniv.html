        <p class="pseo">Yaniv is a rummy type card game for travelers around the world. It is recommended, but not required, to use two decks
        for four or more players.</p>

        <!--------------------- Fill in SEO -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2-5
            |<strong> Type:</strong> Rummy
            |<strong> Supplies:</strong> 1 Deck + Jokers |
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The object of the game is to score the least amount of points each round, and to keep your score under 200 points
        overall or you get removed from the game.</p>

        <h3>Deal</h3>
        <p>Deal five cards to each player, face down. Players may look at their cards. The remaining deck is placed face down in
        the middle to form a stock. Flip the top card of the stock pile face up to form the dump pile.</p>

        <!-- <figure>

        <figcaption>Yaniv card layout set up picture</figcaption> 
    </figure>  -->

        <h3>Card Rank</h3>
        <p>(Highest Rank) King to Ace (Lowest Rank)<br><br>
        Jokers are wild cards but may only be used in sequences.
</p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>The starting player is chosen at random, since they have an advantage. The winner of each round starts the next round.
        Play continues clockwise around the table.
        <br><br>
        Each turn you have one of two options:<br><br>
    -Throw one or more cards from your hand to the dump pile, then pick up a card, OR<br><br>
    -Call “Yaniv” to end the play, if you believe that the total value of your cards is less than that of any other player.
    You may only call “Yaniv” if the total value of your cards is less than 6.

</p>

<h3>Throwing</h3>
<p>A player may throw (discard) any of the following:<br><br>
-Any one card<br><br>
-One set of two or more cards of the same rank<br><br>
-One sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. A joker can be used in a sequence in replacement for
any card. <br><br>

When throwing a sequence, the cards must be thrown in sequential order. When throwing a set, you may choose what order
to throw them in. You may only throw one card or one combination (a set or a sequence) into the dump pile per turn.
</p>

<h3>Picking Up</h3>
<p>No matter how many cards you throw, you only pick up one card. The cards that can be picked up are as followed:<br><br>

-The top card of the stock, or<br><br>
-One of the cards thrown to the dump pile by a previous player, but only the first or last card thrown in a set or
sequence can be picked up.
<br><br>
If the draw pile runs out and no one has announced “Yaniv,” all cards in the dump pile, except for the last player's
discard are shuffled and stacked face down to form a new draw pile.
<br><br>
If at the start of your turn you have 5 or less points in your hand, you may announce “Yaniv.” This ends the round and
each player reveals their hand. You may only announce “Yaniv” on your turn, before you pick up a card.
</p>

        <h3>Card Value</h3>
        <p>Jack/Queen/King: 10<br>
        2-10: Face Value<br>
        Ace: 1<br>
        Joker: 0
</p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>When someone calls “Yaniv” at the beginning of their turn, the round is over, players reveal their hand, and points are
        scored. <br><br>
        -If the caller has the lowest number of points in their hand, the caller gets 0 points for that round, and all other
        players score however many points are in their hand.<br><br>
        -If any other player has the same number of points or fewer points than the caller, the caller scores 30 penalty points
        in addition to the value of points in their hand. Each other player besides the caller in this situation scores the
        points that are in their hand. <br><br>
        
        The player with the lowest card point total in their hand, deals the next round. Players' total scores are kept
        throughout the game, from round to round. Any player whose score surpasses 200 is eliminated from the game.
        <br><br>
        If a player's score reaches exactly 200, their score is reduced to 100.<br><br>
        If a player's score reaches exactly 100, their score is reduced to 50.
</p>

        <h3>Winner</h3>
        <p>Play continues until only one player remains in the game, this player wins. If the last two players surpass 200 at the
        same time, the player with the lowest amount of points is the winner. If they tie, another round is played until the tie
        is broken, the player with the lowest score wins.</p>
