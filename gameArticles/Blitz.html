        <!--------------------- Fill in SEO ----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
        <p class="pseo"> The blitz card game, also referred to as the dutch blitz card game, is an easy draw and discard game for two or more players using one deck of playing cards. You need four tokens per
        person to keep track of lives. The tokens do not have to match and have no significant meaning except for keeping track
        of lives. Place four tokens in front of each player to represent lives where everyone can see. When a player loses a
        life, remove a token. </p>

        <h2>Blitz Rules</h2>
        <!--------------------- Fill in SEO -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <p class="players-type-supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2+
            |<strong> Type:</strong> Elimination 
            |<strong> Supplies:</strong> 1 Deck, 4 Tokens per Player |
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of blitz is to get the value of the cards in your hand as close to 31 as you can get, and not have the
        lowest valued hand. The player furthest from 31 when the round ends loses a life.</p>

        <h3>Deal</h3>
        <p>Each player is dealt three cards, one card at a time. The remaining deck is placed in the middle. The top card of the
        remaining deck is flipped over to start the discard pile. Each player will start with four tokens representing four
        lives.</p>

<h3>Card Values</h3>
<p>Ace: 11<br>
    Jack/Queen/King: 10<br>
    2-10: Face value
    <br><br>
    Card values are only added together if the cards are the same suit. <br>
    The only exception: three of a kind in any card rank has a value of 30.
</p>


        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>The player left of the dealer is first to play. To start your turn you draw a card from either the top of the discard
        pile, or the deck. Once a player draws a card, they decide which card to discard to the discard pile, after they add one
        card to the discard pile, their turn is over. Play moves clockwise with players trying to improve the value of the cards
        in their hand.
        <br><br>
        When a player is comfortable with the value of their hand, they can knock at the beginning of their turn. When you
        knock, you do not draw or discard a card, the knock is considered your turn. After a player knocks, every other player
        gets one more turn of drawing and discarding a card.
        <br><br>
        After the last player has played, all players show their cards. The player with the lowest hand value loses a life.
        <br><br>
        Shuffle the cards, rotate the dealer, and play another round. Play rounds until only one player is left with a token.
</p>

        <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
        <p>If a player has a hand value of 31, this is a blitz, the cards are immediately shown and every other player that doesnâ€™t
        have a hand value of 31 loses a life. <br><br>
        
        If a player knocks, and has the lowest hand value, they lose two lives. <br><br>
        
        If the player that knocks ties with another player for lowest hand value, the player that did not knock is the only
        player that loses a life. <br><br>
        
        If two or more players that did not knock tie for lowest hand value, all of the tied players lose a life. <br><br>
        
        When a player loses their last life (token), they are out of the game.
</p>

        <h3>Winner</h3>
        <p>The winner of blitz is the last player with a life.
