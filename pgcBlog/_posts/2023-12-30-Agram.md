### Objective
The objective of agram is to win the 6th trick of the round.

### Setup
Remove the kings, queens, jacks, 2s, and the ace of spades from the deck. Shuffle the remaining cards.

### Deal
Each player is dealt 6 cards. Place the remaining deck out of the game for the round.

### Card Rank
(Highest Rank) Ace, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 (Lowest Rank)

### Game Play
The player left of the dealer goes first, they lead the trick with any card of their choice. Play continues to the left until all players have played one card into the trick. A player must play a card of the lead suit whenever possible. The lead suit is the suit of the first card played each trick. If they can not play a card of the lead suit, they play any card from their hand.

The player who played the highest ranking card of the lead suit, wins the trick, and leads the next trick. Game play continues until all 6 tricks have been played.

### Winner
The player who wins the 6th trick by playing the highest ranking card in the lead suit wins agram. The winner of agram deals the next game.
