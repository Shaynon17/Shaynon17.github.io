            <p class="players-type-supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 1
                |<strong> Type:</strong> Solitaire
                |<strong> Supplies:</strong> 1 Deck |
            </p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of Following is to build the four foundation piles from the ace in ascending order to the king, in
            rotating suits. The rotation of suits is as follows: a club is played on a heart, a diamond on a club, a spade on a
            diamond, a heart on a spade, and so on, with this pattern repeating.</p>

            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>Deal a row of six face-up cards to form the six tableau piles. Place the remaining deck face down to form the stock.
            Leave room for four foundation piles above the tableau.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p>When an ace becomes available, place it above the tableau to form a foundation pile. Foundation piles are built from the
            ace in ascending order to the king, with suits rotating each card. The rotation of suits is as follows: a club is played
            on a heart, a diamond on a club, a spade on a diamond, a heart on a spade, and so on. Pictured above the setup is the
            ace of hearts foundation pile completed for a visual representation of the order of suits. This is just for an example;
            do not form this pile before starting the game. The top card of each tableau pile and the top card of the waste pile are
            available for play onto a foundation pile. For example, you could move the ace of hearts above the tableau to form the
            first foundation pile, and then move the 2 of clubs onto the ace of hearts.
            <br><br>
            The top card of each tableau pile and the top card of the waste pile are also available for play onto a tableau pile.
            Tableau piles may be built in descending order and in the reversed suit sequence of the foundation piles as follows: a
            heart is played on a club, a club on a diamond, a diamond on a spade, a spade on a heart, and so on. To add a card to a
            tableau pile, it must be one rank lower than the top card of the pile it is being played on and in the proper sequence
            of suits for the tableau, which is the reversed sequence of suits that the foundation piles are built up in. For
            example, in the tableau, the 10 of diamonds could be moved onto the jack of spades. A group of cards in the proper
            sequence may also be moved from one tableau pile onto another, as long as the proper sequence of rank and suit is
            continued. Following the previous example, you could move the jack of spades and the 10 of diamonds onto the queen of
            hearts.
            <br><br>
            If a tableau pile becomes empty, you may fill the space using the top card from the waste pile, the top card of another
            tableau pile, or a sequence from another tableau pile that is in the correct order of suits.
            <br><br>
            When there are no more available moves you want to make, flip the top card of the stock over to form or add to the waste
            pile. The top card of the waste pile is always available for play either onto a foundation pile or a tableau pile, as
            long as the above rules are followed. When the stock is depleted, you may redeal. To redeal, flip over the waste pile to
            reform the stock. You may only redeal once per game. When the stock is depleted twice and there are no more moves, the
            game is over.</p>

            <h3>To Win</h3>
            <p>Following is won if all four foundation piles are built in ascending order from the ace to the king, following the
            rotation of suits. If there are no more moves after the stock is depleted twice and the foundation piles are not
            complete, the game is lost.</p>
