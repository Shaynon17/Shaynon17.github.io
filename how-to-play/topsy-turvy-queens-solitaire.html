            </p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of Topsy-Turvy Queens is to free the face-down cards and build up the eight foundation piles in ascending
            order to the queen.</p>

            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>Deal a row of seven face-down cards, leaving an empty space to the right. Under the row of face-down cards, deal eight
            tableau piles, with four face-up cards each, splayed down. Place the remaining cards face down to form the stock.</p>

                <figcaption>Topsy-Turvy Queens Solitaire card layout set up picture</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p>The top card of the waste pile and the top card of each tableau pile are available for play onto a foundation pile.
            Foundation piles may only be started with a king. When a king becomes available for play, move it onto the first
            face-down card in the row of face-down cards to form a foundation pile. Foundation piles are started from the left of
            this row to the right; the last foundation pile that will be started with a king will be started on the empty space to
            the right of the seven face-down cards.
            <br><br>
            When a king is moved onto a face-down card to start a foundation pile, that face-down card is imprisoned. To free an
            imprisoned card, the foundation pile must be built from the king in ascending order to the queen, in suit. To add a card
            to a foundation pile, it must be one rank higher and of the same suit as the top card of the pile it is being played on.
            Aces can be played on kings to continue this sequence. When a foundation pile is completed by being built up to the
            queen, in suit, the face-down card at the bottom of that pile is moved to the top of that pile, flipped face up, and is
            now available for play only onto another foundation pile.
            <br><br>
            The top card of the waste pile and the top card of each tableau pile are also available for play onto the tableau piles.
            Tableau piles are built in descending order, in suit. To add a card to a tableau pile, it must be one rank lower and of
            the same suit as the top card of the tableau pile it is being played onto.
            <br><br>
            A group of cards may be moved from one tableau pile onto another tableau pile as long as the bottom card of the group
            being moved is one rank lower and of the same suit as the top card of the pile it is being played onto. Additionally,
            every card on top of the card being moved must also be one rank lower and of the same suit as the card it is on top of.
            For example, the 7 of hearts and the 6 of hearts can be moved onto the 8 of hearts. When a tableau pile becomes empty,
            it may be filled by any available card or group of cards in the proper descending order and all of the same suit.
            <br><br>
            When there are no more available moves the player wants to make, flip the top card of the stock over to form or add to
            the waste pile. When the stock is depleted, you may redeal. To redeal, flip the waste pile over to reform the stock. You
            may redeal twice per game. The game is over after the stock is depleted a third time and there are no more moves.</p>

            <h3>To Win</h3>
            <p>Topsy-Turvy Queens is won if all eight foundation piles are built from the king in ascending order to the queen, in
            suit. If there are no more moves after the stock is depleted a third time, and the eight foundation piles are not
            complete, the game is lost.</p>
